\paragraph{Quotient Group}

Consider the following theorem, concerning groups and quotient groups. These results can be generalized to quotient sets and quotient spaces as well. 

\begin{theorem} \label{Theorem_Quotient_Group}
      Let $G, G'$ be two groups. Then, let $\phi: G \rightarrow G'$ be a homeomorphism of kernel $\phi^{-1}(e') = H \subset G$. Then, $H$ is an invariant subgroup of $G$ and the quotient group is isomorphic to $G'$, 
      $$
        \frac{G}{H} \simeq G'
      $$
\end{theorem}
