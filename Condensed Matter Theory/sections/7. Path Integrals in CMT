\subsection{\underline{Path Integrals}}

\paragraph{\textswab{Quantum Propagators and Path Integrals}}

The dynamical information in quantum mechanics is contained in the matrix elements of the time-evolution operator $\bm{\mathcal{U}}(t_f;t_i)$, which for a time-independent Hamiltonian reads

\begin{equation}
    \bm{\mathcal{U}}(t_f;t_i) = e^{-\frac{i {\bf H} (t_i-t_f)}{\hbar}}.
    \label{PathIntegral_propagator}
\end{equation}

The probability amplitude for a particle to start at ${\bf x}_i$-position and $t_i$-time and end at ${\bf x}_f$-position and $t_f$-time is written as 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \bm{\mathcal{U}}(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) &= \bra{x_f} \bm{\mathcal{U}}(t_f;t_i) \ket{x_i} \\
    &= \int_{x_i}^{x_f} \mathcal{D}[x] \exp \bigg[
        \frac{i}{\hbar} \int_{t_i}^{t_f} dt \blanky \mathcal{L}[\cdot{x}, x] 
    \bigg] = \int_{x_i}^{x_f} \mathcal{D}[x] \exp \bigg[
        \frac{i}{\hbar} \mathcal{S}[x(t)],
    \bigg]
\end{split}
\label{PathIntegral_prob_amplitude}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lagrangian and $\mathcal{S}$ is the classical action associated with the $x(t)$-trajectory and where the integration is to be understood as over all paths with starting point $x(t_i) = x_i$ and end-point $x(t_f) = x_f$. Hence, the path integral representation thus provides an elegant interpretation of the quantum-mechanical transition-amplitude, since the particle takes all possible trajectories with each $x(t)$-trajectory contributing $\exp \bigg[-\frac{i}{\hbar}\mathcal{S}[x(t)]\bigg]$ to the amplitude. Moreover, the path integral is an exact representation of the evolution operator $\bm{\mathcal{U}}(t) = \exp\bigg[\frac{\hbar}{i} {\bf H} t\bigg]$ without explicitly incorporating any quantum-mechanical operators. \bigbreak

\paragraph{\textswab{Classical Limit and the Stationary Phase Approximation}}

It can be seen from \cref{PathIntegral_prob_amplitude} that all paths have the same absolute magnitude but with different phase: the phase of each $x(t)$-path is its classical action $\mathcal{S}[x(t)]$
divided by its microscopic action $\hbar$. Hence, each path taken in isolation is equally important, i.e. the classical path is no more important than any arbitrarily complicated path.

However, given that the path integral is a coherent summation of paths, different paths interfere with one another. The important trajectories, hence, contribute significantly to the path integral must be those for which the action varies very slowly when the $x(t)$
-path is slightly deformed, which means that they leave the $\mathcal{S}$-action stationary, i.e.

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\delta \mathcal{S}[x]}{\delta x} = 0. 
\end{equation}

By contrast, the contributions which rapidly oscillating exponential factor add up to zero. Thus, in the classical limit, only one trajectory $x_c(t)$ contributes, that which is the solution to the classical equations of motions. \bigbreak

In the classical limit, $\hbar \rightarrow 0$. In particular, consider a deviation from the classical path $x(t) = x_{\textnormal{cl}}(t) + \eta(t)$, which allows for a second order expansion in this \textit{small} deviation as follows 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
     \bm{\mathcal{U}}(x_f, x_i; t_f - t_i) \simeq& e^{\frac{i}{\hbar} \mathcal{S}_{\textnormal{cl}}[x_{\textnormal{cl}}]} \int_{\eta(t_i) = 0}^{\eta(t_f) = 0} \mathcal{D}[\eta] \blanky \exp \bigg[
            \frac{i}{2\hbar} \int_{t_i}^{t_f} dt \blanky \frac{\delta^{(2)} \mathcal{S}[x]}{\delta x(t) \delta x(t')} \eta(t)\eta(t')
        \bigg] \\
        &= e^{\frac{i}{\hbar} \mathcal{S}_{\textnormal{cl}}[x_{\textnormal{cl}}]} \det \bigg[
            \frac{1}{2\pi \hbar} \frac{\delta^{(2)} \mathcal{S}[x]}{\delta x(t) \delta x(t')} 
        \bigg]^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The quantum correction to the classical action thus measures the strength of the quantum fluctuations. In general, the action for the quantum $\eta$-fluctuations is not the same as the action for the classical trajectory. \bigbreak

\subsubsection{Path integrals in Statistical Mechanics}

Path integrals offer an elegant and powerful technique for calculating observables, in particular correlation functions, for statistical mechanics systems, since -in this formalism- the partition function is a path integral. Hence, the finite-temperature quantum-mechanical properties of the system can be accessible from the path integral. \bigbreak

A statistical ensemble in equilibrium at finite $\beta^{-1}$-temperature is described by a partition function

\begin{equation}
    \partitionfunction = \Tr e^{-\beta {\bf H}}.
\end{equation}

The partition function can be written in the eigenstate basis 

\begin{equation}
    \partitionfunction = \int dx \blanky \bra{x} e^{-\beta {\bf H}} \ket{x} 
    = \int dx \int dx_1 \blanky \bra{x}\ket{x_1}\bra{x_1} e^{-\beta {\bf H}} \ket{x},
\end{equation}

where $\bra{x_1} e^{-\beta {\bf H}} \ket{x}$ can now be viewed as analytic continuation of the propagator \cref{PathIntegral_propagator} to imaginary time $\tau = it$, where the propagation is considered to start at $\tau = 0$ and ending at $\tau = \beta \hbar$, i.e. a Wick rotation which maps Minkowski $\mathds{M}^4$ to a euclidean $\R^4$.
Performing these steps yields the following representation for the propagator 

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        &\bra{x_f} e^{-\beta {\bf H}} \ket{x_i} = \mathcal{N} \int \mathcal{D}[x(\tau)] \blanky e^{-\frac{\mathcal{S}_E[x]}{\hbar}}, \\
        & \mathcal{S}_E[x] = \int_{0}^{\hbar \beta} d\tau {\bf H}(x), \quad \textnormal{ is the Euclidean action. }
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Note that, in the previous relations, the Hamiltonian has replaced the Lagrangian in the action, since $t = -i\tau$. The positive form of the Euclidean actions eliminates any convergence problems in the integral. \bigbreak

Given that the partition function is, by definition, a trace over states, boundary conditions must be imposed s.t. that the initial and final states are the same state $x(0) = x(\hbar \beta)$. Then, a sum a is taken across all such states. 
In other words, the imaginary-time periodic boundary condition reads: $x(\tau) = x(\tau + \hbar \beta)$. 
Taking into account the previous considerations, the partition function now reads,

\begin{equation}
    \partitionfunction = \mathcal{N} \int dx \int_{x(0) = x}^{x(\beta \hbar) = x} \mathcal{D}[x(\tau)] \blanky e^{-\frac{\mathcal{S}_E[x]}{\hbar}}.
\end{equation}

Real-time dynamics and quantum-statistical properties can be obtained by the transformation $t \rightarrow -it$, a Wick rotation of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in the complex-time plane. \bigbreak

\paragraph{\textit{Correlation Functions}}

Usually, one is interested in measuring thermal-averages of (products of) local observables. Analytically, this reads as 

\begin{equation}
    \langle {\bf O}_1 \cdots {\bf O}_n \rangle = \frac{1}{\partitionfunction} \Tr  \bigg( {\bf O}_1 \cdots {\bf O}_n e^{-\beta {\bf H}}\bigg).
\end{equation}

Such averages can be readily obtained in an alternative way, by defining a modified partition function 

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \partitionfunction(h_1, \cdots, h_n) = \Tr e^{-\beta {\bf H} + {\bf H}_{\textnormal{ext}}}, \quad {\bf H}_{\textnormal{ext}} = \sum_{i} h_i {\bf O}_i,
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

wherein ${\bf H}_{\textnormal{ext}}$ represents the Hamiltonian of external sources $h_i$ which couple to the relevant operators ${\bf O}_i$. This allows for the simple representation of an $n$-body correlator as follows 

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \langle {\bf O}_1 \cdots {\bf O}_n \rangle = \frac{1}{\partitionfunction[\{h_i=0\}]} \frac{\partial^n \partitionfunction[h_1, \cdots, h_n]}{\partial h_i \cdots h_{\ell}}\bigg|_{\{h_i = 0\}}.           
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Now, the question aristes as to the possibility of extending this thermal averaging process to correlation functions of the form,

\begin{equation}
    \langle {\bf O}_1(\tau_1) \cdots {\bf O}_n(\tau_n) \rangle =
    \frac{
        \int_{x(0) = x(\beta)}
            \mathcal{D}[x(\tau)] \blanky {\bf O}_1(\tau_1) \cdots {\bf O}_n(\tau_n) e^{-\frac{S_E}{\hbar}}
    }{
        \int_{x(0) = x(\beta)}
            \mathcal{D}[x(\tau)] \blanky e^{-\frac{S_E}{\hbar}}
    }, \textnormal{ where } {\bf O}_i(\tau_i) = {\bf O}_i(x(\tau_i)).
\end{equation}

\begin{remark}

\textnormal{To interpret such a correlation function in imaginary time, one may start by considering the action of operators on a given state function $\ket{\phi(t)}$ at different times. Operator ${\bf O}_1$ acts at $t_1$ s.t. }

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    &\textnormal{Operator ${\bf O}_1$ acts at $t_1$ s.t. } {\bf O}_1 {\ket{\phi(t_1)}} = {\bf O}_1 \bm{\mathcal{U}}(t_1, 0) {\ket{\phi(0)}} \\
    &\textnormal{Operator ${\bf O}_2$ acts at $t_2 > t_1$ s.t. } {\bf O}_2 {\ket{\phi(t_2)}} = {\bf O}_2 \bm{\mathcal{U}}(t_2, t_1)  {\bf O}_1 \bm{\mathcal{U}}(t_1, 0) {\ket{\phi(0)}} \\
    &\Rightarrow 
    \begin{array}{cc}
         \textnormal{The projection of this states }\\
         \textnormal{onto the unperturbed state reads}
    \end{array}
    \bra{\phi(0)} {{\bf O}}_2 {\bm{\mathcal{U}}}(t_2, t_1) {{\bf O}}_1 {\bm{\mathcal{U}}}(t_1, 0) \ket{\phi(0)}  = \bra{\psi(0)}
\end{split}
\end{equation}


\end{remark}
