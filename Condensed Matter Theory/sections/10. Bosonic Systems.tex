%\subsection{Ideal Bose Gas and Bose-Einstein Condensation}

The grand partition function of an ideal bosonic gas reads 

\[
    \mathcal{Z}_G = \prod_{\alpha} \bigg(
        1 - e^{-\beta (\epsilon_{\alpha}-\mu)}
    \bigg)^{-1}, \qquad
    \mathcal{Z}_G = \prod_{{\bf k}} \bigg(
        1 - e^{-\beta (\epsilon_{{\bf k}}-\mu)}
    \bigg)^{-1}
\]

where $\alpha$ labels the quantum states of the gas, and where ${\bf k}$ is the momentum associated to a plane-wave expansion of the partition function. 

It is clear that, at finite temperatures, $\mu < \varepsilon_{{\bf k}}$, for all momenta ${\bf k}$, otherwise, the occupation number of some $k'$-state, with $\varepsilon_{k'} = \mu$, will diverge. 
Since the lowest-energy state has energy $\varepsilon_0$, it follows that $\mu \leq 0$.
However, at zero temperature, this condition can be relaxed. \medbreak

Since bosonic states have no restriction on their occupation numbers, special care must be taken when making transitions from a summation to an integral over ${\bf k}$. In effect, contrast the following two cases.\medbreak

Consider a 3D system in contact with a particle reservoir that fixes the value of $\mu$. 
One finds the equation of state \ref{el2020advanced} 

\[
    PV = \frac{2}{3} U.
\]

On the contrary, if now the system of bosonic particles is enclosed in an impermeable box and in contact with a temperature reservoir $T$, with particle number $N$ fixed, the following equation of motion is obtained 

\[
    \frac{N \lambda_T^3}{g\Omega} = \frac{n \lambda_T^3}{g} = F_{\frac{3}{2}}(\alpha), 
\]

where $\lambda_T = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi \hbar^2}{m k_B T}}$ is the thermal de Broglie wavelength and where $F_{\frac{3}{2}}$ is the polylogarithmic function. 

If the temperature is lowered to $T' < T$, then $\lambda_{T'} > \lambda_T$, and hence $\alpha' = e^{\beta' \mu} > \alpha$, since $\mu < 0$. Moreover, $\mu$ has
