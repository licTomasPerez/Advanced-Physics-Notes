\section{\textbf{Variational Wave Functions and Parent Hamiltonians}}

\blanky \\

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback =yellow, title = Physical Context]

The ground state for most non-ferromagnetic Heisenberg models are not known. Even those that are known in analytical form, such as the Bethe solution in one dimension, require numerical simulation computations for their spin correlations. Variational wave functions provide an educated guess for the ground state. Physical insight can be gained by a variational calculation, where the energy is minimized with respect to a chosen set of parameters. The variational approach go further beyond the regimes of any particular expansion scheme -semiclassical, large-$N$, or others. \\

A fundamental idea behind the Variational approach is that of the parent Hamiltonian. This is the Hamiltonian for which a particular wave function happens to be the exact ground state. Although the Hamiltonian may differ from the physical model by extra interactions, it serves to enhance the understanding of the system by bringing into light the relation between interactions and ground state correlations. \\

\paragraph{\textbf{Valence Bond States}}

The valence bond states are variational wave functions for antiferromagnetic Heisenberg models, having been studied extensively i nthe context of quantum magnetism and high-temperature superconductivity. Their general form is 

\begin{equation}
    \ket{\{c_{\alpha}\}, S} = \sum_{\alpha} c_{\alpha} \ket{\alpha}, \begin{array}{c}
         \textnormal{ where $c_{\alpha}$ are the variational parameters and }  \\
         \ket{\alpha} = \prod_{i,j \in \Lambda_{\alpha}} \bigg({\bf a}_i^\dagger {\bf b}_i^\dagger - {\bf b}_i^\dagger {\bf a}_i^\dagger \bigg) \ket{0},
    \end{array}
    \label{Valence_bond_states}
\end{equation}

where ${\bf a}_i, {\bf b}_i$ are Schwinger bosons on the $i$-th site, and where $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ is a particular configuration of the (ij)-bonds on the lattice. The condition on $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ is that precisely $2S$ bonds will emanate from each site. In certain cases, the sum on 
\cref{Valence_bond_states} is dominated by a finite number of configurations in the large lattice limit\footnote{

The cases where there are macroscopicaly many configurations were denoted \underline{resonanting valence bonds states} (RVB) by Anderson.

}. \\

From inspection of \cref{Valence_bond_states}, it is clear that all bond operators ${\bf a}_i^\dagger {\bf b}_i^\dagger - {\bf b}_i^\dagger {\bf a}_i^\dagger$ are invariant under global spin rotations, making $\ket{\{c_{\alpha}\}, S}$ a singlet of total spin. A special class of valence bond states is given by 

\begin{equation}
    \ket{\hat{u}, S} = \sum_{\alpha} \bigg(\prod_{(ij) \in \alpha} u_{ij}\bigg) \ket{\alpha},
    \label{special_class_Valence_bond_states }
\end{equation}

wherein there are upto $\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ independent variational parameters $u_{ij}$, with $N$ being the number of lattice sites. Furthermore, if the bond parameters are both bipartite and positive, this is 

\begin{equation}
    u_{ij} = \left\{\begin{array}{c}
       u_{ij} > 0  \textnormal{ if } \begin{array}{c}
            i \in A  \\
            j \in B
       \end{array}  \\
       0 \textnormal{ if $i,j$ are on the same sublattice}
    \end{array}\right.,
\end{equation}

then the $\ket{\hat{u}, S}$-states obey the Marshall sign criterion \cref{Marshall_theo_1}, as required for the ground state of a bipartite Heisenberg antiferromagnet. 

\clearpage 

A Schwinger boson mean field state is defined as 

\begin{equation}
    \ket{\hat{u}} = \exp \bigg[\frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} u_{ij} \bigg({\bf a}_i^\dagger {\bf b}_i^\dagger - {\bf b}_i^\dagger {\bf a}_i^\dagger\bigg)\bigg], \textnormal{ with } u_{ij} = -u_{ji}.
    \label{Schwinger_mean_field_state}
\end{equation}

Such states are generated by the Schwinger boson mean field theory of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which will be reviewed later on. The $\ket{\hat{u}}$-state contains contributions of different spin sizes at all sites, and therefore is not a bona fide spin state. It can be transformaed, by a Bogoliubov transformation on the Schwinger bosons, into a factorizable Fock state, which is in fact a vacuum of the transformed bosons. Moreover, the correlations of the mean field states can be evaluated analytically. The valence bond state, given by \cref{special_class_Valence_bond_states }, can be constructed from \cref{Schwinger_mean_field_state} via a projection. Said projection is given by the operator defined in \cref{Schwinger_boson_projector},

$$
    \ket{\hat{u}, S} = \mathbf{P}_S \ket{\hat{u}},
$$

where the projected state is non-factorizable, due to correlations introduced by ${\bf P}_S$, said correlation being much easier to evaluate in $\ket{\hat{u}}$ -the Schwinger boson mean field state- than in the special class of valence bond states, $\ket{\hat{u}, S}$. \\

\paragraph{\textit{Spin one-half States}}

Consider the spinor states for $S = \frac{1}{2}$-states, given by 

\begin{align}
    \ket{\uparrow_i} &= {\bf a}_i^\dagger \ket{0}, & \ket{\downarrow_i} &= {\bf b}_i^\dagger  \ket{0}.
\end{align}

Any bipartite valence bond configuration, those given by \cref{Valence_bond_states}, that obeys the Marshall sign criterion can be written in a normalized form as a product of singlet bonds,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \ket{\alpha}_{S = \frac{1}{2}} = \prod_{(ij) \in \Lambda_{\alpha}}^{{\substack{{i \in A}\\
                                 {i \in B} }}}
    \frac{\ket{\uparrow_i}\ket{\downarrow_j}-\ket{\downarrow_i} \ket{\uparrow_j}}{\sqrt{2}},  \begin{array}{c}
         \textnormal{ where the spin }  \\
         \textnormal{ correlations are } \\
         \textnormal{ are simply } 
    \end{array} \langle \spin_i \spin_j \rangle = \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
         \frac{3}{4} & i = j  \\
         -\frac{3}{4} & (ij) \in \Lambda_{\alpha} \\
         0 & (ij) \notin \Lambda_{\alpha}
    \end{array}\right..
    \label{bipartite_valence_bond_states_corrs}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Thus, if the bonds in $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ are short range, $\ket{\alpha}_{S=\frac{1}{2}}$ is a disordered spin liquid state. Different valence bond configurations are not orthogonal, for their finite overlap is given by 

\begin{equation}
    \bra{\alpha}\ket{\beta} = \prod_{\ell \in \bra{\alpha}\ket{\beta}} 2^{1- \frac{L_{\ell}}{2}} = 2^{N_{L}^{(\alpha \beta)} - N}, \begin{array}{c}
         \textnormal{ where, in the first equality, the product is made over all loops $\ell$  } \\
         \textnormal{ of $L_{\ell}$-length found in the overlap in the two configurations.  }
    \end{array} 
\end{equation}

For two identical bonds in $\alpha, \beta$, a length $L = 2$ loop is produced. In the second identity of the preceding equation, $N_L$ is the total number of loops and $N$ is the number of sites on the lattice. Since $\ket{\alpha}$ contains one bond per site, and the coordination number of all simple lattices is equal to or larger than two, the $\ket{\alpha}$-states break lattice translational symmetry. This symmetry can be restored in \cref{Valence_bond_states} by summing over $\alpha$. \\

From now, the discusion will be restricted to nearest-neighbour bonds or dimers, for the one and two-dimensional cases separately. \\

\paragraph{\textit{The Majumdar-Ghosh Hamiltonian}}

Majumdar and Ghosh introduced the Hamiltonian,

\begin{equation}
    {\bf H}^{\textnormal{MG}} = \frac{4 |K|}{3} \sum_{i=1}^N \bigg(\spin_i \cdot \spin_{i+1} + \frac{1}{2} \spin_{i} \cdot \spin_{i+2}\bigg) + \frac{1}{N}, \textnormal{ where } \spin_{N+1} = \spin_1,
\end{equation}

and where $i$ labels the sites of one-dimensional chain with even number of sites. It can be proved that this Hamiltonian is the parent Hamiltonian of the two-dimer states, 

\begin{equation}
    \ket{d}_{\pm} = \prod_{n=1}^{\frac{N}{2}} \frac{\ket{\uparrow_{2n}} \ket{\downarrow_{2n\pm1}} - \ket{\downarrow_{2n}} \ket{\uparrow_{2n \pm 1}}}{\sqrt{2}}, \textnormal{ where } {\bf H}^{\textnormal{MG}} \ket{d}_{\pm} = 0, 
    \label{dimer_states}
\end{equation}

and that all other eigenenergies are positive. Thus, should this statement be true, $\ket{d}_{\pm}$ span the ground state manifold of the Majumdar-Ghosh Hamiltonian. \\

This Hamiltonian includes antiferromagnetic interactions between next-nearest neighbours, which partially frustate the nearest neighbour correlations. Thus, the ground state can be expected to be more disordered than the pure nearest-neighbour model. Indeed, the correlations of the Bethe wave function of the nearest-neighbour model decay as an inverse power of distance, while  \cref{bipartite_valence_bond_states_corrs} states that the dimer state correlations vanish beyond a single lattice constant. 

\begin{proof}

Consider a total spin triad of spins at sites $(i-1, i, i+1$) is given by 

\begin{equation}
    {\bf J}_i = \spin_{i-1} + \spin_i + \spin_{i+1},
\end{equation}

whose squares has eigenvalues $J(J+1)$, where $J = \frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}$. The main pinning point of this proof is that the Majumdar-Ghosh Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of projection operators,

\begin{equation}\begin{split}
    {\bf H}^{\textnormal{HG}} = |K| \sum_{i} \mathcal{P}_{\frac{3}{2}}(i-1,i,i+1), \textnormal{ where } 
        \mathcal{P}_{\frac{3}{2}}(i-1,i,i+1) &= \frac{1}{3} \bigg({\bf J}_i^2 - \frac{3}{4}\bigg) \\
        &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3} \bigg(\spin_{i-1} \cdot \spin_i + \spin_{i - 1} \cdot \spin_{i+1} + \spin_{i} \cdot \spin_{i+1} \bigg). 
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Since ${\bf J}_i^2$'s eigenvalues are $J(J+1)$, this $\mathcal{P}_{\frac{3}{2}}(i-1,i,i+1)$-operator clearly annihilates any state with total spin $J = \frac{1}{2}$ of the triad $(i-1, i, i+1)$. Dimer states, given by \cref{dimer_states}, do not contain states with total ${\bf J}^z > \frac{1}{2}$ of any three sites, since two of the three spins have cancelling ${\spin}^z$ quantum numbers.

Consider a triad with ${\bf J}^z = \frac{1}{2}$ but $J = \frac{3}{2}$ and a global $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{u}(2)$-rotation on $\ket{d}$. This will admix, by application of ${\bf J}_i^+$, a component of ${\bf J}_i^z = \frac{3}{2}$ into wave function, which contradicts the rotational invariance of $\ket{d}$\footnote{Remember that dimer states are given in terms of Schwinger boson creation operators acting on the system's ground state. These Schwinger boson creation operators, as stated in \cref{Schwinger_bosons_are_su2vectors}, transform as $SU(2)$-vectors. }. Then, there are no triads with total spin $J > \frac{1}{2}$ and therefore each $\mathcal{P}_{\frac{3}{2}}(i-1,i,i+1)$operator annihilates the dimer states, $\ket{d}_{\pm}$. And given that the $|K|\mathcal{P}_{\frac{3}{2}}(i-1,i,i+1)$-operators are non-negative operators, for these are projection operators, $\ket{d}_{\pm}$ span the ground state manifold of the Majumdar-Ghosh Hamiltonian.

\end{proof}

\paragraph{Square Lattice RVB States}

On the square $S=\frac{1}{2}$-lattice, the resonating valence bond states, given by \cref{Valence_bond_states}, fulfill all the requirements of Marshall's theorems,  \cref{Marshall_theo_1} and \cref{Marshall_theo_2}, for the quantum antiferromagnet\footnote{\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=LimeGreen, title = Historical Context]

These states were proposed as candidates for spin liquid ground states by P.W. Anderson. Although the nearest-neighbour antiferromagnets, on the square lattice is ordered at zero temperature, these states are very poplar in the context of doped antiferromagnets and high-temperature superconductivity. 

\end{tcolorbox}}. For RVB states, it is not easy at all to evaluate correlation for the $\ket{\alpha}$-components are not orthogonal. The number of different bond converings on the square lattice increases exponentially with the number of sites. Moreover, M.E. Fisher has calculated that the number of dimer configurations on the square lattice grows exponentially with the lattice size. \\

Numerical Monte Carlo simulations by Liang, Doucot, and Anderson on finite lattices suggest that the RVB state has no long-range order for bonds that decay at least as rapidly as 

$$
    u_{ij} \approx |{\bf x}_i - {\bf x}_j|^{-p}, \textnormal{ with } p \geq 5.
$$

The RVB states can thus be used as variational ground states for both ordered and disordered phases, making these appealing candidates for studying the transition from the Néel antiferromagnet to a paramagnetic phase. \\

\paragraph{Valence Bond Solids and AKLT Models}

The valence bond solids are defined as follows 

\begin{equation}
\ket{\Psi^{\textnormal{VBS}}} = \prod_{\langle ij \rangle} \bigg({\bf a}^\dagger {\bf b}^\dagger - {\bf b}^\dagger {\bf a}^\dagger\bigg)^M \ket{0}, \begin{array}{c}
     \textnormal{where $\langle ij \rangle$ are all the nearest neighbour bonds of the lattice} \\
     \textnormal{ and where $M \in \mathds{Z}$ such that } M  =\frac{2S}{z} \begin{array}{cc}
          \textnormal{ where $z$ is the lattice }  \\
          \textnormal{ coordination number}
     \end{array}.
     \label{valence_bond_solids}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

From the definition it is clear that $S$ is restricted to values depending on the lattice structure. For instance for $(d=1)$-lattices, $S = 1, 2, \cdots$ and for $(d=2)$-lattices, $S = 2,4, \cdots$. \\

Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb and Tasaki (AKLT) constructed the parent Hamiltonians for the VBS states, given by 

\begin{equation}
    {\bf H}^{\textnormal{AKLT}} = \sum_{\langle ij \rangle} \sum_{J = 2S-M+1}^{2S} K_J \mathcal{P}_{J}(ij), \blanky K_J \geq 0.
\end{equation}

The bond-projector $P_J(ij)$ projects the bond spin ${\bf J}_{ij} = \spin_i + \spin_j$ onto the subspace of $J$-magnitude. Any power of $m = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$ of $\spin_i \cdot \spin_j$ can be written in terms of powers of ${\bf J}_{ij}$ and expanded as a linear combination of bond projector operators 

\begin{equation}
    (\spin_i \cdot \spin_j)^m = \sum_{J = 0}^{2S} \bigg[\frac{1}{2} J(J+1) - S(S+1)\bigg]^m \mathcal{P}_J (ij),
\end{equation}

this relation being useful for inverting the bond-projection operators as polynomials of $\spin_i \cdot \spin_j$. \\

\begin{lemma}

The valence bond solids, defined in \cref{valence_bond_solids}, are the eigenstates of the AKLT-Hamiltonian, 

\begin{equation}
     {\bf H}^{\textnormal{AKLT}} \ket{\Psi^{\textnormal{VBS}}} = 0,
\end{equation}

which holds if $\ket{\Psi^{\textnormal{VBS}}}$ has no component with bond spin $J_{ij} > 2S - M $, for any $(ij)$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

In effect, consider the contribution to $\ket{\Psi^{\textnormal{VBS}}}$ made by the term with maximally possible number of creation Schwinger operators, ${\bf a}^\dagger$ in particular, on a particular bond $(ij)$,

\begin{equation}
    \cdots ({\bf a}_i^\dagger)^{2S-M} \bigg({\bf a}^\dagger {\bf b}^\dagger - {\bf b}^\dagger {\bf a}^\dagger \bigg)^{M} ({\bf a}_j^\dagger)^{2S-M}\cdots.
\end{equation}

By counting the power of the ${\bf a}^\dagger$-operators minus the number of ${\bf b}^\dagger$-operators, the maximum eigenvalues of ${\bf J}_{ij}^z$ acting on \cref{valence_bond_solids}
is 

\begin{equation}
    {\bf J}^z_{\textnormal{max}} = 2S-M
\end{equation}

\end{proof}

TODO: continue it.

\section{\textbf{Ground States and Excitations}}

\blanky \\

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback =yellow, title = Physical Context]

The focus of previous sections has  been primarily on the ground state of the Heisenberg model. Knowledge of the exact ground state (or in lack of the exact ground state, a good variational state) allows for the calculation of the equal time spin correlations at zero temperature. Experiments, however, can only measure dynamical responses at finite frequencies and finite temperatures. As it turns out, these dynamical correlations depend on the excited states and energies. \\

The ground state correlations can be used to construct certain approximate low-lying excitations. This approach is called the \textbf{single mode approximation} (SMA). Furthermore, the Heisenberg antiferromagnet provides an opportunity to demonstrate the SMA for a system with a highly-correlated ground state. 

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = LimeGreen, title = Historical Context]

The SMA was originally devised by Bijl and Feynmann  to determine the photon-roton dispersion curve in superfluid He4.

\end{tcolorbox}

In this section, the information about spin excitations and correlations is embodied primarily by the dynamical structure factor and some derived quantities, 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    &\mathcal{S}({\bf q}, \omega) = \frac{1}{N} \int_{\mathds{R}} dt e^{i \omega t} \blanky \sum_{ij} e^{i {\bf q} \cdot ({\bf x} - {\bf x}_j)} \langle \spin_i^z(t) \spin_j^z(0) \rangle = \frac{2\pi}{NZ} \sum_{\alpha, \beta} e^{-\beta E_{\alpha}} \bra{\alpha} \spin_{{\bf q}}^z \ket{\beta} \bra{\beta} \spin^z_{-{\bf q}} \ket{\alpha} \delta(\omega + E_{\alpha} - E_{\beta}), \\
    &\mathcal{S}({\bf q}) = \int_{\mathds{R}} \frac{d\omega}{2\pi} \blanky \mathcal{S}({\bf q}, \omega) = \frac{1}{N} \langle \spin_{{\bf q}}^z \spin_{-{\bf q}}^z \rangle,  \begin{array}{c}
         \textnormal{ which is the equal-time}  \\
         \textnormal{ correlation function }
    \end{array} \\
    &\mathcal{F}({\bf q}) = \frac{1}{N} \bigg \langle \bigg[\spin_{{\bf q}}^z, [\spin_{-{\bf q}}^z, {\bf H}]\bigg] \bigg \rangle = \int_{\mathds{R}} \frac{d\omega}{2\pi} \blanky \omega \mathcal{S}({\bf q}, \omega), \begin{array}{cc}
         \textnormal{ which is the double commutator function, previously } \\
         \textnormal{  encountered in the proof of the Mervin-Wagner} \\
         \textnormal{ theorem,  \cref{Mervin-Wagner}.}
    \end{array}
    \label{Goldstone_spin_dynamical_factors}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Note that, even though $\mathcal{F}({\bf q})$ is a static ground state expectation value, it contains dynamical information through the Hamiltonian. These relations thus show that the $\mathcal{S}({\bf q})$ and $\mathcal{F}({\bf q})$ describe the average and the first frequency moment of $\mathcal{S}({\bf q}, \omega)$, respectively. Hence, a characteristic frequency for spin excitations at ${\bf q}$-momentum is defined as 

\begin{equation}
    \bar{\omega}_{{\bf q}} = \frac{\mathcal{F}({\bf q})}{\mathcal{S}({\bf q})}. 
    \label{Goldstone_char_freq}
\end{equation}

\blanky \\

\paragraph{The Single Mode Approximation}

Consider a quantum system with ground state $\ket{0}$. By translational invariance, all excitations may be labelled by the lattice ${\bf q}$-momentum. A "single mode" is constructed then as 

\begin{equation}
    \ket{{\bf q}} = \spin^z_{{\bf q}} \ket{0}.
\end{equation}

The single mode state approximates a true excitation of the system if $\mathcal{S}({\bf q}, \omega)$ at $T = 0$ is sharply peaked about $\omega = \bar{\omega}_{\bf q}$, i.e.

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{S}({\bf q}, \omega) \approx 2\pi \mathcal{S}({\bf q}) \delta(\omega- \omega_{\bf q}),
\end{equation}

which will be precise if 

\begin{equation}
    ({\bf H} - E_0)\ket{{\bf q}} = \omega_{{\bf q}} \ket{{\bf q}}.
\end{equation}

In general, even if this holds exactly, the single mode states are only a small subset of all excitations -i.e. those connected to the ground state via $\spin^z_{\bf q}$. If their products are also elementary excitations, they can be considered as weakly interacting elementary excitations. Thus, their energies approximately determine the system's low-frequency response and low-temperature thermodynamics. In \cref{Quantum_disorder_zero_temp_MW}, it was mentioned that a non-zero gap in the excitation spectrum in the Heisenberg model implies the absence of long-range order at zero temperature (ie. in said conditions, the ground state of the Heisenberg model must be disordered). In this case, the dynamical structure factor must vanish below the gap frequency 

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{S}({\bf q}, \omega) = 0, \textnormal{ for } \omega \in (0, \Delta).
\end{equation}

Then, the single-mode energy $\bar{\omega}_{{\bf q}}$ is an upper bound on the lowest-excitation energy at ${\bf q}$-momentum,

\begin{equation}
    \min_{\alpha} E_{\alpha}({\bf q}) \leq \bar{\omega}_{{\bf q}}.
    \label{Goldstone_Single_mode_approx_ineq}
\end{equation}

However, the existence of an energy gap $\Delta^{\textnormal{SMA}}$ in the single-mode spectrum,

\begin{equation}
    \Delta^{\textnormal{SMA}} \leq  \bar{\omega}_{{\bf q}}, \textnormal{ } \forall {\bf q}.
\end{equation}

does not imply the existence of a true gap for the exact eigenergies $E_{\alpha}$. \\

\paragraph{\textbf{Goldstone's Theorem in Condensed Matter Physics}}

The \cref{Goldstone_Single_mode_approx_ineq}'s inequality serves not to prove the existence of a gap in the excitation spectrum, but rather to disprove its existence ie. it can be used to prove gaplessness. Thus, the lattice-version of the Goldstone theroem can be used on the Heisenberg model. \\

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = yellow, title = Physical Context]

The essence of Goldstone's theorem is that for a Hamiltonian with short-range interactions and no gauge fields, spontaneously broken continuous symmetry implies the existence of low-energy excitations called \underline{Goldstone modes}. If the ground state has $\bar{\bf q}$-momentum, the energy of the Goldstone mode vanishes as ${\bf q} \rightarrow \bar{\bf q}.$

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = Bittersweet, title = Example]

For example, 

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\bar{ \bf q} = 0$ for the ferromagnet, 
    \item $\bar{ \bf q} = \pi$ for the Néel antiferromagnet in the cubic lattice.
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}

In relativistic field theories, Goldstone modes represent massless particles. In condensed matter physics on the other hand, Goldstone modes appear in many systems, eg.

\begin{itemize}
    \item acoustic phonons in solids that break translational symmetry, 
    \item spin waves in O$(n)$ Heisenberg models, or $n > 1$ with $n$ the dimension of the spins. 
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}

\blanky \\

Consider the short-range Heisenberg Hamiltonian, given in \cref{HH_short_range_MW}, which satisfies the conditions of the Mervin-Wagner theorem, \cref{Mervin-Wagner}. Then, the following theorem holds

\begin{theorem}\label{Goldstone_theo} Goldstone's Theorem \\

If the spin correlation diverges at some ${\bar{\bf q}}$-wave vector, ie.

$$
    \lim_{{\bf q} \rightarrow \bar{\bf q}} \mathcal{S}({\bf q}) \rightarrow \infty,
$$

then there exists a \textnormal{Goldstone mode} labelled by the ${\bf q}$-momentum, whose energy $E({\bf q})$ vanishes at ${\bar {\bf q}}$, ie.

$$
    \lim_{{\bf q} \rightarrow \bar{\bf q}} E({\bf q}) = 0.
$$

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

In effect, consider the characteristic frequency for spin excitations at ${\bf q}$-momentum, defined in \cref{Goldstone_char_freq} and \cref{Goldstone_spin_dynamical_factors}. The double commutator, which appears in both relations, has an upper bound given by \cref{Bogoliubov_inequality_double_comm}, which in turn induces a lower bound on the characteristic frequency. Thus, for $h=0$, 

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{F}({\bf q}) \leq \cancel{h m_{{\bf q}}} + S(S+1) \bar{J} |{\bf q}|^2 \blanky \Longrightarrow \blanky \bar{\omega}_{{\bf q}} \leq \frac{2S(S+1) \bar{J} |{\bf q}|^2}{\mathcal{S}({\bf q})}.
\end{equation}

Then, consider the case in which $\lim_{{\bf q} \rightarrow \bar{\bf q}} \mathcal{S}({\bf q}) \rightarrow \infty$. Furthermore, \cref{Goldstone_Single_mode_approx_ineq} induces an upper bound on the lowest-level excitation energy at a fixed $\bar{\bf q}$-momentum  

$$    
\min_{\alpha} E_{\alpha}({\bf q}) \leq \bar{\omega}_{{\bf q}} \rightarrow \infty \textnormal{ which implies that } \lim_{{\bf q} \rightarrow \bar{\bf q}} E({\bf q}) = 0.
$$
\end{proof}

\blanky \\

\begin{corr}

If the ground state has broken symmetry, there exists Goldstone modes, as in \cref{Goldstone_theo}. 

\end{corr}

\begin{proof}

This statement follows directly from \cref{MW_Broken_Symm_and_Long_range_order}'s red box titled "Spontaneously broken symmetry and true long-range order", in which it is proven that an spontaneously broken symmetry implies true long-range order and the divergence of $\mathcal{S}({\bf q})$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$. 

\end{proof}

\blanky \\

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = yellow, title = Physical Context]

It is important to note that the converse of the Goldstone theorem is false, ie. the existence of gapless excitations does not imply true long-range order. Notable counterexamples are,

\begin{itemize}
    \item the Fermi gas, which has gapless particle-hole excitations but no long-range order,
    \item and the $S= \frac{1}{2}$-one-dimensional Heisenberg model has gapless excitations which vanish at $q = \{0, \pi\}$ with ${\omega}_{q} \propto |\sin q|$ but is correlation decay algebraically at long distances. 
    \item The Haldane gap in the $S=1$-AKLT models. 
          
          The ground states of the AKLT models are valence bond solids, with single mode energies given by 
          
          $$
              \bar{\omega}_{\bf q} \geq 0.370K.
          $$
          
          As discussed earlier, although the single-mode spectrum has a gap of magnitude $0.370K$, this doesn't imply that a gap actually exists in the exact spectrum. However, numerical simulations for the $S=1$-AKLT model support the existence of a gap of magnitude $\Delta = 0.350K$. The same simulation for the standard Heisenberg model shows the existence of a gap of size $0.325K$. Since the AKLT model has a gap in the SMA-spectrum, this numerical evidence suggests that the additional biquadratic terms $\frac{K}{3} (\spin_i \cdot \spin_j)^2$ do not drastically alter neither the ground state correlations nor the low lying excitation of the $S=1$-Heisenberg model in one dimension. Furthermore, the Haldane gap survives in the thermodynamical limit, this being a general feature of integer spin quantum antierromagnets in low dimensions.

\section{Linear Response Theory}

Linear response theory is an extremely widely used concept in physics, stating that the response to a weak external perturbation is proportional to the perturbation, and therefore the quantity of interest is the proportionality constant. The physical question to ask is thus: supposing some perturbation $H'$, what is the measured consequence for an observable quantity ${\bf A}$. In other words, what is $\langle {\bf A} \rangle$ to linear order in $H'$? 

Among the numerous physical application of the linear response formalism, one can mention charge and spin susceptibilities of eg. electron systems due to external electric or magnetic fields. Responses to external mechanical forces or vibrations can also be calculated using the same formalism. \\

\paragraph{\textbf{The general Kubo formula}}

Consider a quantum system described by a time independent Hamiltonian ${\bf H}_0$ in thermodynamic equilibrium. This means that an expectation value of a physical quantity, described by the operator ${\bf A}$, which can be evaluated as 

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \langle {\bf A} \rangle = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_0} \textnormal{Tr }_{\mathds{H}} \rho_0 {\bf A}  = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_0} \sum_{n \in \Lambda} \bra{n} {{\bf A}} \ket{n} e^{-\beta E_n} \\
        \rho_0 = e^{-\beta {\bf H}_0} = \sum_{n \in \Lambda} \ket{n} \bra{n} e^{-\beta E_n},
    \end{split} \begin{array}{c}
         \textnormal{ where $\{\ket{n}\}_{n \in \Lambda}$ is a complete} \\
         \\
         \textnormal{set of eigenstates}.
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

Suppose now that at some time, $t = t_0$, an external perturbation is applied to the system, driving it out of equilibrium. The perturbation is described by an additional time dependent term in the Hamiltonian 

\begin{equation}
    \Hamiltonian(t) = \Hamiltonian_0 + \Hamiltonian'(t) \theta(t-t_0)
\end{equation}

Now, the interest lies in finding the expectation value of the ${\bf A}$ operator at times $t$ greater that $t_0$-. In order to do so, the time evolution of the density matrix must be found, or equivalently the time evolution of the eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Once $\ket{n(t)}$ is found, the time-dependent expectation value can be found as 

\begin{align}
        \langle {\bf A}(t) \rangle = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_0} \textnormal{Tr }_{\mathds{H}} \rho(t) {\bf A}  = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_0} \sum_{n \in \Lambda} \bra{n(t)} {{\bf A}} \ket{n(t)} e^{-\beta E_n} \\
        \rho_0 = e^{-\beta {\bf H}_0} = \sum_{n \in \Lambda} \ket{n(t)} \bra{n(t)} e^{-\beta E_n},
\end{align}

The physical idea behind this expression is as follows. The initial states of the system are distributed according to the usual Boltzmann distribution $\frac{e^{-\beta E_{0n}}}{\mathcal{Z_0}}$. At later times, the system is described by the same distribution of states but the states are now time-dependent and they have evolved according to the new Hamiltonian. The time dependence of the states $\ket{n(t)}$ is governed by the Schr\"odinger equation. Since $\Hamiltonian'$ is regarded to be a small perturbation, the interaction picture representation is suitable for this setting. In this representation, the time dependence is given by 

\begin{equation}
    \ket{n(t)} = e^{-i\Hamiltonian_0 t} \ket{n(t)}_I = e^{-i\Hamiltonian_0 t} \mathcal{U}(t, t_0) \ket{\hat{n}(t_0)},
\end{equation}

where by definition $\ket{\hat{n}(t_0)} = e^{i \Hamiltonian_0 t_0} \ket{n(t_0)} = \ket{n}$.

Up to linear order in $\Hamiltonian'$, the time evolution operator $\mathcal{U}(t, t_0)$ can be written 

$$
    \mathcal{U}(t, t_0) = \mathds{1} - i \int_{t_0}^t dt' \Hamiltonian'(t') + \mathcal{O}(\Hamiltonian^{'2})
$$

Then, using this in the time-dependent expectation value yields 

\begin{equation} \begin{split}
    \langle {\bf A}(t) \rangle &= \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_0} \sum_{n \in \Lambda} \bra{n(t)} {{\bf A}} \ket{n(t)} e^{-\beta E_n} \\
    &= \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_0} \sum_{n \in \Lambda} \bra{n(t_0)} \bigg(\mathds{1} - i \int_{t_0}^t dt' \Hamiltonian'(t')\bigg) e^{-i \Hamiltonian_0 t_0} {{\bf A}} e^{i \Hamiltonian_0 t_0} \bigg(\mathds{1} - i \int_{t_0}^t dt' \Hamiltonian'(t')\bigg) \ket{n(t_0)}  e^{-\beta E_n}+ \mathcal{O}(\Hamiltonian^{'2}) \\
    &= \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}_0} \sum_{n \in \Lambda} \bra{n(t_0)} {{\bf A}} \ket{n(t_0)} - \frac{i}{\mathcal{Z}_0} \int_{t_0}^{t} dt' \sum_{n \in \Lambda} e^{-\beta E_n} \bigg( e^{-i \Hamiltonian_0 t_0} {{\bf A}} e^{i \Hamiltonian_0 t_0} \Hamiltonian'(t') - \Hamiltonian'(t')e^{-i \Hamiltonian_0 t_0} {{\bf A}} e^{i \Hamiltonian_0 t_0} \ket{n(t_0)} \bigg) \\
    &= \langle {{\bf A}} \rangle_{0} + \int_{t_0}^{t} \frac{dt'}{i} \langle[{{\bf A}}(t), \Hamiltonian'(t')]\rangle_{0},
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where the brackets $\langle \rangle_{0}$ means an equilibrium average with respect to the Hamiltonian $\Hamiltonian$. This is in fact a remarkable and very useful result since the inherently non-equilibrium quantity $\langle {{\bf A}}(t) \rangle$ has been expressed as a correlation function of the system in equilibrium. The physical reason for this is that the interaction between excitations created in the non-equilibrium state is an effect to second order in the weak perturbation, hence not included in the linear response. \\

The correlation function is the retarded correlation function, which can be rewritten as 
the difference between $\langle {{\bf A}}(t) \rangle \textnormal{ and } \langle {{\bf A}}\rangle_0 $ ie. 

\begin{align} 
        & \alignedbox{\delta \langle {{\bf A}}(t) \rangle }{
        = \int_{t_0}^{\infty} dt' \mathcal{C}_{AH'}^{R}(t,t') e^{-\eta(t-t')} \textnormal{ where } \mathcal{C}_{AH'}^{R}(t,t') = -i \theta(t-t') \langle[{{\bf A}}(t), \Hamiltonian'(t')]\rangle_{0}},
\end{align}

which is the Kubo formula. This expresses the linear response to a perturbation $\Hamiltonian'$. Note that the factor $e^{-\eta(t-t')}$, with an infinitesimal positive parameter $\eta$, has been included to force the response at time $t$ due to the influence of $\Hamiltonian'$ at time $t'$ to decay when $t >> t'$. At the end of the calculation, the limit $\eta \rightarrow 0^+$,. This is so since the retarded effect of a perturbation must decrease in time\footnote{The other, the advanced correlation function is non-physical and must be ditched. The other one, the retarded correlation function, decreases exponentially with time, the exponential factor thus picks out the physically relevant solution by introducing an artificial relaxation mechanism.}. \\

\paragraph{\textbf{Kubo fromula in the frequency domain}}

It is often convenient to express the response to an external disturbance in the frequency domain via Fourier transformations\footnote{Consider the $L^1$-space, ie. the space of all integrable functions on the real line. Then the Fourier transform and the Fourier-anti transform can be defined as 
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{F}[f(t)](\omega) = f(\omega) = \int_{\R} dt e^{i\omega t} f(t) \blanky \textnormal{ and } \blanky \mathcal{F}^{-1}[f(\omega)](t) = f(t) = \int_{\R} \frac{d\omega}{2\pi} e^{-i\omega t} f(\omega)
\end{align}

}. Therefore, consider the perturbation Hamiltonian $\Hamiltonian'$, which can be rewritten in terms of its Fourier components 

\begin{equation}
    \Hamiltonian'(t) = \int_{\Omega \subset \R} \frac{d\omega}{2\pi} e^{-i\omega t} \Hamiltonian'_\omega,
\end{equation}

such that the retarded correlation function becomes 

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{C}_{AH'}^{R}(t,t') = \int_{\mathds{R}} \frac{d\omega}{2\pi} e^{-i\omega t'} \mathcal{C}_{AH'_\omega}^{R}(t-t') \begin{array}{c}
         \textnormal{since $\langle[{{\bf A}}(t), \Hamiltonian'(t')_{\omega'}]\rangle_{0}$ only depends } \\
         \textnormal{ on the difference between $t$ and $t'$. }
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

Therefore, inserting this result into the Kubo formula yields

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \delta \langle {{\bf A}}(t) \rangle
        &= \int_{t_0}^{\infty} dt' \mathcal{C}_{AH'_\omega}^{R}(t,t') e^{-\eta(t-t')} \\
        &= \int_{\R} dt' \int_{\R} \frac{d\omega}{2\pi} e^{-i\omega t} e^{-i(\omega + i\eta) (t'-t)} \mathcal{C}_{AH'_\omega}^{R}(t-t') \\
        &= \int_{\R} \frac{d\omega}{2\pi} e^{-¿i\omega t} \bigg(\int_{\R} d(t'-t) e^{-i(\omega + i\eta)(t'-t)} \mathcal{C}_{AH'_\omega}^{R}(t-t')\bigg) \\
        &= \int_{\R} \frac{d\omega}{2\pi} e^{-i\omega t} \mathcal{C}_{AH'_\omega}^{R}(\omega; \eta) 
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

which can be inverted to yield the final result in the frequency domain

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \int_{\R} {dt} e^{i\nu t}
        \delta \langle {{\bf A}}(t) \rangle &= \int_{\R} {dt} e^{i\nu t} \int_{\R} \frac{d\omega}{2\pi} e^{-i\omega t} \mathcal{C}_{AH'_\omega}^{R}(\omega; \eta) \\
        \langle {{\bf A}}_\nu \rangle &= \int_{\R} \frac{d\omega}{2\pi} \int_{\R} dt e^{i(\nu - \omega)t} \mathcal{C}_{AH'_\omega}^{R}(\omega; \eta) \\
        &= \int_{\R} {d\omega} \delta(\nu - \omega) \mathcal{C}_{AH'_\omega}^{R}(\omega; \eta) \\
        &= \mathcal{C}_{AH'_\nu}^{R}(\nu; \eta) 
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
       & \alignedbox{\Rightarrow \delta \langle {{\bf A}}_\omega \rangle = \mathcal{C}_{AH'_\omega}^{R}(\omega) \textnormal{ with } \mathcal{C}_{AH'_\omega}^{R}(\omega)}{ = \int_{\R} dt e^{i\omega t} e^{-\eta t} \mathcal{C}_{AH'_\omega}^{R}(t)},
\end{align}

{where the infinitesimal $\eta$ parameter is incorporated } { in order to ensure the correct physical result, ie.} {the retarded response function decays at $t>>1$.} \\

\paragraph{\textbf{Kubo formula for conductivity}}

Consider a system of charged particles, eg. electrons, which is subjected t an external electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field induces a current and the conductivity is the linear response coefficient. In the general case, the conductivity is a non-local quantity in both time and space, such that the electric current ${{\bf J}_e}$ at some point ${\bf x}$ at time $t$ depends on the electric field at points ${\bf y}$ at times $t'$, eg.\footnote{Note that this section's mathematical treatment is not Lorentz-covariant. This is, the spacetime is treated as $\R^4$ with the metric being $g_{\mu \nu} = \delta_{\mu \nu}$} 

\begin{equation}
    J^{\alpha}_{e}(x^\mu) = \int_{\Omega \subset \R^4 } dx^{\mu} \sum_{\alpha \beta} \sigma_{\beta}(x^\mu, y^{\mu}) E^{\beta} (y^{\mu}), \begin{array}{c} 
         \textnormal{ where $\sigma_{\alpha \beta}(x^\mu, y^{\mu})$ is the conductivity tensor, which  } \\ 
         \textnormal{ describes the current response in the } \\
         \textnormal{ ${\bf e}_\alpha$-direction to an applied }
         \textnormal{ electric field in the ${\bf e}_\beta$-direction.}
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

The electric field ${\bf E}$ is given by the electric potential $\phi_{ext}$ and the vector potential ${\bf A}_{\textnormal{ext}}$ as $
{\bf E}(x^\mu) = -\partial_{\mu} A^{\mu}$. For electrons, the current density can be written as ${\bf J}_e = -e \langle {\bf J} \rangle$. The perturbing term in the Hamiltonian due to the external electromagnetic field is given by the coupling of the electrons to both the scalar potential and the vector potential. Then, upto linear order in the external potential, 

$$
\Hamiltonian_{\textnormal{ext}} = -e \int_{\R^3} d{\bf x} J_{\mu}({\bf x}) A^{\mu}_{\textnormal{ext}}(x^{\mu}).
$$

Let, ${\bf A}_0$ denote the vector potential in the equilibrium ie. prior to the onset of the perturbation ${\bf A}_0(x^{\mu}$ and let ${\bf A}_0(x^{\mu})$ denote the total vector potential. Then, 

$$
   {\bf A}(x^{\mu}) = {\bf A}_{0}(x^{\mu}) +  {\bf A}_{\textnormal{ext}}(x^{\mu}).
$$

The current operator can be decomposed in two components, the diamagnetic and the paramagnetic terms, as follows 

\begin{equation}
    {\bf J} = {\bf J}^{\nabla}({\bf x}) + \frac{e}{m} {\bf A}({\bf x}) \rho({\bf x}).  
\end{equation}

For simplicity and using gauge invariance, the external electric potential can be set to zero. The conductivity is most easily expressed in the frequency domain via a Fourier transformation of the perturbation. Since 

\begin{equation} \begin{array}{cc}
     \partial_t \overset{\mathcal{F}}{\rightarrow} -i\omega \blanky & \textnormal{ then } \blanky {\bf A}_{\textnormal{ext}}({\bf x}, \omega) \overset{\mathcal{F}}{\rightarrow}  \frac{1}{i\omega} {\bf E}_{\textnormal{ext}}({\bf x}, \omega) \\
\end{array}
     \Rightarrow \Hamiltonian_{\textnormal{ext}, \omega} = \frac{e}{i\omega} \int_{\Omega \subset \R^3} d{\bf x} \blanky {\bf J}({\bf x}) \cdot {\bf E}_{\textnormal{ext}}({\bf x}, \omega).
\end{equation}

In order to exploit the frequency domain formulation of linear response theory, it is desirable to find the corresponding formula for the conductivity tensor in frequency-space. The conductivity tensor is a property of the equilibrium system and can thus onyly depend on time differences $ \sigma_{\alpha \beta}(x^\mu, y^{\mu}) =  \sigma_{\alpha \beta}({\bf x},{\bf y}, t-t')$. The frequency transform of the conductivity yields

\begin{equation}
    J^{\alpha}_{e}({\bf x}, \omega) = \int_{\Omega \subset \R^3 } d{\bf y} \blanky \sum_{ \beta} \sigma_{\alpha \beta}({\bf x},{\bf y}, \omega) E^{\beta}({\bf y}, \omega).
\end{equation}

Now, given that he external perturbation, written in frequency space, is already linear in the external potential ${\bf E}_{\textnormal{ext}}$, and given that the interest lies only on terms proportional to said perturbation, the conductivity can be rewritten as
